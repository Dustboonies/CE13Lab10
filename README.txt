Collaboration: None, I have no friends still.

Summary:
I think the important aspects of this lab were working with the VC100 and learning how to use different forms
of prints and also communication with the terminal.  Also, another important part of this lab was learning
how to use GCC and the UCSC unix servers (which are currently down at 11PM on Wednesday night so I was unable
to test my code).  I would definitely include more guidance concerning the GCC and running the code within the
lab manual as I spent a good 7 hours trying to figure this out before I found help on piazza.

Approach:
I began by initially working on the libraries and completing them which was quite simple.  I then moved onto the
main class and the print statements which took me quite a while as learning the VC100 commands was quite challenging
but I eventually got that part.  After that I spent a long time attempting to get my code to compile; however, the
Unix servers were down (or I was unable to connect to them) and thus I was unable to test my code as I don't have
GCC on my computer.  If I was to do this lab again, I would try to initially get communication with the unix server
working so that I would be able to test my code.

Conclusion:
The lab ended up relatively easy at the end.  The only trouble I had was trying to test my code on the unix server
(which I will stress again were down).  I probably spent about 20 hours on this lab, a relaxing amount compared
to battle boats which took over 2 and a half times the time to complete.  I thought learning about the VC100
commands were quite interesting as well as making a game was pretty cool.  I didn't like that the servers were down
when I tried to test my code but what can I do.  I think this was a worthwhile lab, I would have liked the older
version better though as testing it on the pickit is MUCH easier, especially since we have done that many times
before and I would only have to worry about the lab rather than how to test my code as well.  I would add more
guidance in the lab manual to make this lab better.  The grading seems appropriate, maybe appropriate more points
towards the print statements as those were harder to figure out.  There weren't really many discussions on this lab
so I can't say if they were helpful or not.
